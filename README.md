# using-ryckandmorty-api
This is a mini project where i try to use the api of Rick and Morty, and make a page where u can get basic info about a random character.
I am open to suggestions, i am a begginer yet, and if someone could help with an image for be my page's icon, i'd be very grateful.
Here is the GitHub page: https://camilorodriguezg.github.io/using-ryckandmorty-api/
